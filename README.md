This IoT-based Smart Noise Pollution Monitor is designed to continuously track and analyze urban noise levels and environmental conditions in real time. Utilizing sound, vibration, and temperature sensors, the system gathers accurate data on noise pollution and its contributing factors. The collected information is transmitted via MQTT, with Node-RED serving as the MQTT client and cloud.shiftr.io as the MQTT broker, ensuring reliable data flow and seamless integration. This scalable, cost-effective solution facilitates prompt identification of noise pollution hotspots and empowers data-driven decisions for enhanced urban planning and environmental management. The system also supports robust analytics, visualization, and automated alerting functionalities.
